; swap the theoretical values of rdi and rsi
; only use push and pop not any mov crap
;fundamental to know to understand how the stack and it's regs work

push rdi
push rsi
pop rdi
pop rsi

;pushing a value (not necessarily stored in a register) means writing it to the stack.

;popping means restoring whatever is on top of the stack into a register. Those are basic instructions:

;another example below

push 0xdeadbeef      ; push a value to the stack
pop eax              ; eax is now 0xdeadbeef

; swap contents of registers
push eax
mov eax, ebx
pop ebx
